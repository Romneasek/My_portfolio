# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/Romneasek/Predicting_Seoul_Bike_Rented_Count)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**47%** accuracy](https://github.com/Romneasek/Predicting_Seoul_Bike_Rented_Count).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Romneasek/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis)

<img src="images/LR.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit..

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**89.29%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/Romneasek/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important feature.
- Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis

[Orthopedic patient prediction](https://github.com/Romneasek/Orthopedic_patient_prediction)

<img src="images/KNN.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that I classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the the patient is normal or abnormal [**82.26%** accuracy using Naive Bayes algorithm](https://github.com/Romneasek/Orthopedic_patient_prediction).

- Used K-Nearest-Neighbors and GaussianNB to classify Normal or Abnormal paitents.
- Analysed different parameters to classify patients.
- Explored a machine learning approach to Medical Analysis.
