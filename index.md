# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/Romneasek/Predicting_Seoul_Bike_Rented_Count)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**47%** accuracy](https://github.com/Romneasek/Predicting_Seoul_Bike_Rented_Count).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Romneasek/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis)

<img src="images/LR.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit..

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**89.29%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/Romneasek/Portuguese_Bank_Marketing_Analysis).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important feature.
- Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced data.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis

[Orthopedic patient prediction](https://github.com/Romneasek/Orthopedic_patient_prediction)

<img src="images/KNN.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that I classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the the patient is normal or abnormal [**82.26%** accuracy using Naive Bayes algorithm](https://github.com/Romneasek/Orthopedic_patient_prediction).

- Used K-Nearest-Neighbors and GaussianNB to classify Normal or Abnormal paitents.
- Analysed different parameters to classify patients.
- Explored a machine learning approach to Medical Analysis.

[Talking data fraud detection](https://github.com/Romneasek/Talking_data_fraud_detection)

<img src="images/TD.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, XGBoost Classifier, Bagging Classifier

**Project Objective:**In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict whether a given click resulted in a downloaded or not.[**99%** accuracy using XGBoost algorithm](https://github.com/Romneasek/Talking_data_fraud_detection).Accuracy by Using Bagging Classifier [**99%**](https://github.com/Romneasek/Talking_data_fraud_detection).

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud.
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
- Explored Ensemble technique.

[Hand Written Digits Recognition](https://github.com/Romneasek/HandWritten_Digits_Recognition)

<img src="images/CV.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:**Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 handwritten digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Neural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the convolution neural network to attain [**99%** accuracy using **10** epochs](https://github.com/Romneasek/HandWritten_Digits_Recognition).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
